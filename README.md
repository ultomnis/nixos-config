# Nix Flakes

A repository containing my personal configurations for NixOS, Home Manager, System Manager, and nix-darwin.

## Hosts

- `sirius`: PC with an AMD CPU and GPU running NixOS. Home Manager is used as a module.

- `canopus`: M-series MacBook using nix-darwin. Home Manager is used as a module.

- `alpha-centauri`: Steam Deck running SteamOS. Uses Home Manager (standalone) and System Manager.

Secrets are managed using agenix and a private GitHub repository.
